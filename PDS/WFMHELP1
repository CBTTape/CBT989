#General information.
} The WFM dialog shows captured data from when members are added or
} updated. Deleted members are removed from the database and thus
} cannot be shown.
}
#Panel info
} -  The panels typically contains an input field for selection data.
} -  The panels are screen size sensitive, you will see a different
}    layout depending on whether the screen is wider or slimmer than
}    120 characters. It also adjusts to the hight by supressing some
}    blank lines if the screen hight is less than 30.
} -  The input field allows mask when noted. Mask characters are % for
}    a single character and * for many or no characters.
}
} Notes to the member list.
}  -  The 'Cat' columm shows if the dataset is cataloged - Y means yes,
}     N means no and O means cataloged to another volume.
}     Dataset access is in any case done using the volser, if possible.
}
} Notes to the dataset list.
}  -  The 'Ty' columm shows the dataset type L for loadlib and S for
}     source.
}  -  The 'Do' columm shows the dataset organisation.
}  -  The 'Rf' columm shows the dataset record format.
}  -  The 'Mbrn' columm shows the number of members for partitioned
}     datasets. This information may not be present and was in any case
}     computed the last time the updater job ran.
}  -  The 'Cat' columm shows if the dataset is cataloged.

#General primary commands
} Adm           Switch to administration display.
} ALL           Show all records (alias for the RESET command).
} Dsn_Ýd¨       Switch to dataset display, optionally with a
}               datasetname.
} Find_Ýt_Ýd¨¨  Find text t with optional direction d from the current
}               top line. t must be quoted if it contains one of the
}               direction kwywords. d can be FIRST, LAST, PREV or NEXT,
}               where NEXT is default. Note that d may actually be
}               specifed before t and Find may be entered without any
}               parameters for a repeated find (though only for NEXT).
} Key_Ýk¨       Switch to member-by-datasetkey display, optionally with
}               a key.
} Mbr_Ým¨       Switch to member display, optionally with a membername.
} Only_t        Show only lines containing t. t is case insensitive.
}               t may contain mask characters * and/or %. If mask
}               characters are not used, then *t* is assumed.
} RESet         Show all lines.
} SORT_n        Sort by name. The valid sort criteria are
}                Member display
}                 -  NAME, DSNAME, DSN, or DATE. Null equals name.
}                    DATE actually sorts by date}time.
}                Dataset display
}                 - NAME, DSNAME, DSN, VOLSER or VOL. Null equals name.
} STate         Show dialog and database states.
} Vol_Ýv¨       Switch to volume display, optionally with a volser.
} Where_t       Alias of Only, see that for details.
}
} o  Switching beteen displays are horizontally, meaning that switching
}    to i.e. the DSN display and then hitting END/RETURN will terminate
}    the dialog.
} o  Dataset- and membername must be at least 3 characters, volser may
}    be a single asterix.
} o  Filter characters are % for a sngle character, and * for many or
}    none.
}
#Line commands
} The ones shown. Line commands specifying dataset- or member access
