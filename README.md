//***FILE 989 is from Willy Jensen, and contains a fantastic        *   FILE 989
//*           package called FINDMEM that can take a member name    *   FILE 989
//*           (or masked name) and tell you all the datasets in     *   FILE 989
//*           the entire system, which contain that name, or        *   FILE 989
